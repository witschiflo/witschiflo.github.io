It all started during the semester break after studying computer science for half a year. I asked myself how cool it would be to have my own website. With this thought in mind, I went ahead and bought the domain florianwitschi.ch. The hosting was set up via GitHub pages and I created the HTML, CSS and Javascript files. But what to do next? I didn't even know what an HTML tag was and had never learned anything about web development. Therefore, tutorials had to come to my aid and I built the page together. The end result can be seen:

In the meantime, 2.5 years have passed, I know what an HTML tag is and I am no longer a student&#x1F609;. But how should the revised website look like? Probably the best thing to do is to completely rethink the website again. I believe that Simon Sinek's [Golden Circle](https://simonsinek.com/golden-circle/) are well suited for this purpose.

# The Golden Circle
The Golden Circles state that the question of Why should be asked before the question of How and What. Simon explains the meaning of the rings very well in his [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action).

## Why
When asking the question of why, you have to ask yourself why you do what you do. Why do I have my own website? I would define my Why as follows:

*"The sharing of knowledge and experiences that I would have liked to read myself before."*

I believe that more can be achieved with collaboration and the sharing of experiences. When I have a question about a technical topic, I like to get help and read a blog post, for example. Also with other topics I love to read experience reports. By now I would say that I have gained quite a bit of knowledge and experience that other people can benefit from. Therefore, the goal with this website is to help other people.

## How

A blog is very suitable for writing regular articles. As recommended by [Andrej Kaparti](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/), I will use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for this. Jekyll can also be hosted on GitHub Pages and therefore fulfils all my requirements. There already exist a lot of templates for Jekyll. I decided to use the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and customise it to my needs.

## What
Finally, there is the question of What. This raises the question of what exactly the blog articles will contain. It is imaginable, for example, to share tips about studying. It is also possible to cover technical topics in the blogs. Maybe travel reports or topics related to personal development will also be covered. In short, many things are conceivable, but nothing is certain yet. Therefore, I suggest you come with me on this journey and see what the future will bring...
