It all started during the semester break after studying computer science for half a year. Imagine how cool it would be to have my own website. So I got started and bought the domain florianwitschi.ch. The hosting was set up via GitHub pages and I created the HTML, CSS and Javascript files. But what to do next? I didn't even know what an HTML tag was and had never learned anything about web development. Therefore, tutorials had to come to my aid and I built the page together. The end result can be seen:

Now 2.5 years have passed and I am not a student anymore&#x1F609;. But how should the revised website look like? Probably the best thing to do is to completely rethink the website again. I believe it is a good idea to follow Simon Sinek's [Golden Circle](https://simonsinek.com/golden-circle/) and first ask the question of why.

# The Golden Circle
The Golden Circle describe that the question WHY we do what we do should be asked first. Only then should the question be asked what we do, and at the very end what we do.  

## Why
Now the question is what is the Why of the website? I would formulate it as follows:  

*"The sharing of knowledge and experiences that I would have liked to read myself before."*

This could be about knowledge and experiences of any kind. It is imaginable, for example, to share tips about studying. Technical knowledge in the field of computer science and travel experiences also fall under this category. In short, everything that other people could possibly benefit from.

## How

A blog is very suitable for writing regular articles. As recommended by [Andrej Kaparti](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/), I will use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for this. Jekyll can also be hosted on GitHub Pages and therefore fulfils all my requirements. There already exist a lot of templates for Jekyll. I decided to use the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and customise it to my needs.

## What
Finally, there is the question of what. As already mentioned, this can be experiences and knowledge of any kind. How that will look in concrete terms, the future will show...
