The time as a student is definitely a period that has shaped me. It spanned over several years and I got familiar with many new topics. But I not only learned the technical stuff, but also acquired interpersonal and analytical skills. Looking back, it was definitely an educational and pleasant time. In this post I have listed some tips that I learned during my studies. If you also want to study, these points will probably be helpful to you.

# Everything is temporary
How often have you been unable to see the forest out of the trees? This will definitely happen to you during your studies. The deadline or the exam will come and then this phase is over. Of course you have to perform well in order to complete this period successfully. But if you want it and give yourself into the subject, then some things will work out, even if it doesn't look like it in the meantime. You will look back on the moments when you didn't know how everything should work out with a smile and your self-confidence will also benefit from it.

# Learn from failures
You will certainly make mistakes in exams, assignments and presentations. That's fine, as long as you learn something from them. Studying is the time of learning. If you had already mastered everything, then you wouldn't need to study anymore. Therefore, look at every mistake as a chance to get better. This requires that you are open to criticism and face your mistakes. If you overcome the mistakes and get them right the next time, it will feel twice as good.

# Collaborate
This point connects to one of my favorite quotes:

*"Teamwork makes the dream work"*

You will certainly have areas in which you are particularly good and other areas where you can benefit from your fellow students. You will benefit from others when they explain a topic to you and will also benefit when you explain topics to someone else. But collaboration can go much further, anyone can forget a submission and be glad for the reminder from a fellow student. Of course, there are tasks and assignments where cooperation is strictly forbidden and this must be respected, but apart from that it will definitely make your life easier.

# Embrace the journey
In my opinion, this is the most important lesson I have learned during my studies (that doesn't mean that the other points are not relevant &#x1F609;). Your studies will certainly be a road with many ups, downs, setbacks and successes. Even if you sometimes wish that it is over, I think you should enjoy this time. The moments from everyday university life are definitely unique and depending on your life situation, you also have a lot of freedom. I think in such a situation you should really enjoy the moments and not just long for the end to realize that it is over.

# Conclusion
In summary, these are the most important points I learned during my studies. Of course, this list is incomplete and there are other points that are not listed. But these points alone will most likely help you with your studies.
