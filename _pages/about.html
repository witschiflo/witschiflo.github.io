<p>
    Hello together <span class="wave">&#x1F44B;</span><br><br>
    As you might have guessed, my name is Florian Witschi and I am from Switzerland.
    This is my personal website and I am glad that you landed on it.<br><br>
    Since my bachelor's degree in computer science, I have been working as a software developer.<br><br>
     In my free time, I like to go for a run and spend time in nature.<br><br>
</p>
